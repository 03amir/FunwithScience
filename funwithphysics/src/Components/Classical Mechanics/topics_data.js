        details: `Momentum is a vector quantity, defined as the product of the mass of a particle and its velocity. From Isaac Newton’s second law of motion we can see that the rate of change of momentum is equal to the force acting on the particle.
        

        From Newton’s second law it follows that, if a constant force acts on a particle for a given time, the product of force and the time interval is equal to the change in the momentum. Conversely, the momentum of a particle is a measurement of the time, required for a constant force to bring it to rest.`,
        formula: "p = mv",
        process: "Here, the linear momentum is defined by p, m is the mass of the system and v is its velocity. We can calculate the momentum (p) by multiplying Mass of the particle (m) with the velocity of the particle (v). The SI unit for momentum is kg · m/s."
